== 0.2.0 03/29/10

This release significantly changes the internals of Gitgo. Old gitgo branches
will not be compatible. To migrate a gitgo-0.1.* branch to the new storage
format:

  % git clone git://github.com/bahuvrihi/gitgo.git
  % cd gitgo
  % git checkout migrate-0.2.0
  % ruby script/migrate.rb PATH_TO_REPO SOURCE_BRANCH TARGET_BRANCH

Then rename the target branch as necessary.

* changed document serialization format to JSON
* complete overhaul of internal classes
* implemented a more robust system for calculating
  (and drawing) a document graph
* temporary removal of comments
* improvements to indexing system
