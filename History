== 0.3.0 04/26/10

Updated internal data store to (more or less) halve the overhead of each new
document by storing document information inline with associations. Index now
assigns shas an integer index for faster comparisons and smaller index files.
Continued overhaul of internals. General updates to the interface.

== 0.2.0 03/29/10

This release significantly changes the internals of Gitgo. Old gitgo branches
will not be compatible. To migrate a gitgo-0.1.* branch to the new storage
format:

  % git clone git://github.com/bahuvrihi/gitgo.git
  % cd gitgo
  % git checkout migrate-0.2.0
  % ruby script/migrate-0.2.0.rb PATH_TO_REPO SOURCE_BRANCH TARGET_BRANCH

Then rename the target branch as necessary. You will also have to remove the
old gitgo files:

  % cd <path_to_repo>
  % rm -rf .git/gitgo

Major changes:

* changed document serialization format to JSON
* complete overhaul of internal classes
* implemented a more robust system for calculating
  (and drawing) a document graph
* temporary removal of comments
* improvements to indexing system
