h1. Setup

Gitgo tracks issues, comments, and wiki pages on a dedicated branch ('gitgo') separate from your development branches. Gitgo sets this branch up for local use, but needs your help to share updates with a remote repository.

h2. Push Changes

  % git push origin gitgo



  

 You will have to push this branch to your origin to share it from a central location.  Once you've added content:

  % git push origin gitgo

Now the origin will have your gitgo branch.
