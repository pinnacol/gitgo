Gitgo -- git-driven issues, comments, and a wiki... to go.

== Description

Gitgo is an issue tracker that stores issue information in a git repository.

At present gitgo is in a developmental state. While the backend and data model
both work and appear to be robust, the front-end is highly lacking. Usage will
be difficult without insider knowledge.

== Usage

In the working directory for a git repository:

  % gitgo

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in a web browser. 

== Installation

Gitgo is not available as a gem yet.  To clone the project and build your own:

  % git clone git://github.com/pinnacol/gitgo.git
  % cd gitgo
  % rake gem
  % gem install pkg/gitgo-...

== Development 

Gitgo is open-source and welcomes help from the community!  To get started:

  % git clone git://github.com/pinnacol/gitgo.git
  % cd gitgo
  % rake test

To see bugs tracked in the gitgo repo:

  % bin/gitgo
