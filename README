= Gitgo

Gitgo -- git-driven issues, comments, and a wiki... to go.

== Description

Gitgo is an issue tracker that stores issue information in a git repository.
At present gitgo is in a developmental state. While the backend and data model
both work and appear to be robust, the front-end is highly lacking, as is
documentation that would allow you to manually setup the repo using the
standard git commands.

Usage will be difficult without prior knowledge.

== Usage

In the working directory for a git repository:

  % gitgo

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in a web browser.

== Installation

Gitgo is not available as a gem yet.  To clone the project and build your own:

  % git clone git://github.com/pinnacol/gitgo.git
  % cd gitgo
  % rake gem
  % gem install pkg/gitgo-...
