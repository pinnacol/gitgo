h2. What is a 'dangling blob'

Dangling blobs are files that git created but did not commit, or were in some other manner disconnected from references in the repo. A dangling blob can be created like this:

code.. 
  % git init
  % echo 'old content' > file.txt
  % git add file.txt
  % echo 'new content' > file.txt
  % git add file.txt
  % git commit -m "added new content"
  % git fsck
  dangling blob 33194a0a6f3f99e366d606c24d9b1ab0e0086e69
  % git cat-file -p 33194a0a6f3f99e366d606c24d9b1ab0e0086e69
  old content

p. Similarly a dangling tree and a dangling commit are objects that have become disconnected from the repo.
