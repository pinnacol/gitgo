h1. Troubleshooting

h2. I can't push my gitgo issues (non-fast forward)

This happens when your local gitgo branch has diverged from the remote tracking branch (ex: origin/gitgo).

code.. 
  % git push

  Compressing objects: 100% (26/26), done.

     cd2c401..0c4e420  dev -> dev
   ! [rejected]        gitgo -> gitgo (non-fast forward)
   ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast forward)
  error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:pinnacol/gitgo.git'
  To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected.
  Merge the remote changes before pushing again.
  See 'non-fast forward' section of 'git push --help' for details.

p. In the browser, go to the "the repo":http://localhost:8080/repo and update doing both a push and pull.  Or if you want to solve it manually:

code.. 
  % git checkout gitgo
  % git pull
  % git push
